//! The damage between two frames of **our own** recording.
//!
//! `damage.rs` does the same job for `iced_tiny_skia`'s layers, and needs three tricks to do it:
//! iced's own `Layer::damage` pairs items by index (so an insertion in the middle of a list
//! over-reports), text is compared through a closure that skips its content, and the quads have to
//! be pulled out of the layers entirely because they are painted in z-order and paired by geometry
//! instead. None of that is needed here, and the reason is the recording: [`Item`] is one flat list
//! of commands, each already carrying its clip, so the damage is a merge-join over that list and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! What it buys, in one line: a canvas that redraws a stroke animation appends the strokes that are
//! already finished as *equal* items, so the frame damages the stroke that is still growing rather
//! than the whole picture. `iced_tiny_skia` cannot see that — one canvas is one indivisible item
//! there — which is why hello's animation is the test case for this renderer.
//!
//! # Why geometry, and not the index
//!
//! The two lists are sorted by bounds first and then walked together. A merge-join visits items in
//! the same order whenever their geometry is the same, so an item that appears in the middle of a
//! frame costs that item and nothing after it — which is exactly what index pairing gets wrong, and
//! what was measured on the launcher: one tile's pressed wash is one more quad, and pairing by
//! index damaged 82,027 px where the tile's own wash is 19,733.
//!
//! Sorting is stable, which is what makes two commands in the *same* rectangle (a fill and its
//! border) keep their relative order and pair with their own kind rather than swapping.
